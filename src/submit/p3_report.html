<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
Give a concise description of current problem.  What
needs to be solved?  Why is the result useful?  Do you make any assumptions?
What are the anticipated difficulties?

In this programming assignment, we are supposed implement an AI algorithm for Qubic tic-tac-toe game. We make our own heuristic function to evaluate the current board and use minimax and alpha-beta purning algorithms to get the best move.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>Give a concise description of the implemented method. For example, you might
  describe the motivation of your idea, the algorithmic steps of your methods, or
  the mathematical formulation of your method.

</p>

<p>
Briefly outline the functions you created in your code to carry out the
algorithmic steps you described earlier.
<ul>
  <li>ultimateheuristic(board,depth,player,alpha,beta);</li> 
  <li> new_minimax(): This function takes 4 inputs: board,depth, player,alpha and beta. Board and player are used to calculate the heuristic value at the leaf node. Depth is for look ahead. alpha and beta are for alpha-beta purning. The function will generate all the possible moves by the player, evaluate all the possible boards and return the best score of the board. By using alpha-beta purning, we can make ou program faster by cutting branches of the tree.</li>
  <li>possibleWinLines(board,player): This function take two inputs: board and player. It will return all the possible winning combinations based on the current board for a certain player.</li>
  <li>almostWinInLine(board, position_list, player): This is a helper function which takes 3 inputs. This function will return whether a player has 3 pieces placed on a winning row already, and there is no enemy's move on that row.</li>
  <li>hasWon(board,player): This function will return whether a player has already won.</li>
</ul>>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<br>
Describe your experiments, including the number of tests that you
performed, and the relevant parameter values.
    <br><b>Experiment 1 : Our AI vs. Our AI with same level of lookahead of 2 for 100 times:</b>
    <br/>Result: Player 1 have a slightly higher winning rate. The average moving time for player 1 is 0.345 seconds.
    <br/> The output looks like this:

    <br><b>Experiment 2: Our AI with  lookahead of 2 vs. random player for 100 times:</b>
    <br/>Result: We <b>destroyed</b> the random Player. We won all the games.
    <br/> The output looks like this:

</p>
<p>
Define your evaluation
metrics, e.g., detection rates, accuracy, running time. </p>


<hr>
<h2> Results</h2>
<p>
List your experimental results.  Provide examples of input images and output
images. If relevant, you may provide images showing any intermediate steps.  If
your work involves videos, do not submit the videos but only links to them.
Our heuristic function correctly evalute the current board, and our minimax algorithm correctly give us the best move. Our AI beats the random player everytime and it also beats the human player.

<h2> Discussion </h2>

<p> 
Discuss your method and results:
<ul>
<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method? </li>
<li>Do your results show that your method is generally successful or
     are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your
     experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your
     results. </li>
<li>Potential future work. How could your method be improved?   What
would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the
failures/limitations of your work?</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p>
Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions?  What is your
main message?

In general, we made our own heuristic function to evaluate the whole board. Then we used minimax and alpha-beta purning algorithms to make the decisions and improve the performance of the system.

<h2> Credits and Bibliography </h2>
<p>

Cite any papers or other references you consulted while developing
your solution.  Citations to papers should include the authors, the
year of publication, the title of the work, and the publication
information (e.g., book name and publisher; conference proceedings and
location; journal name, volume and pages; technical report and
institution).  

<p>
Material on the web should include the url and date of access.
