<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
Given some skeleton code that had an implementation of playing a 3D 4 x 4 x 4 Tic-Tac-Toe game, we needed to create an AI algorithm that could reliably play and beat an opponent using the minmax method, alpha-beta pruning, and our own heuristic value calculations. This way, the AI would be able to look ahead and calculate the best move to make, supposedly avoiding any possible losses. This experiment is important as it teaches us how to properly approach the concepts of developing the rules for an AI when tasked with making something approachable, which is a skill we will need the further we actually delve into Artificial Intelligence. </p>
<p> The biggest difficulty in approaching this problem is having to design a heuristic function that will allocate an appropriate amount of points depending on the board state, while not neglecting the possibility that the player might win or lose in the future. 
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>Give a concise description of the implemented method. For example, you might
  describe the motivation of your idea, the algorithmic steps of your methods, or
  the mathematical formulation of your method. </p>

<p>
We separated our approach to this problem in three separate blocks: designing the heuristic value calculation, the minmax method, and the alpha-beta pruning.
</p>

<p>
  For the heuristic value calculation, we first had to design the rules for how we would rate a certain board state, and whether it would be beneficial or not for the AI player. We settled on counting the number of total available lines for the AI player in a board state as a starting point value, with the total available lines meaning the number of lines on the Tic-Tac-Toe board that contain our pieces and are not blocked by an enemy piece, with higher point values being more beneficial. After counting that, it adds extra points for the number of lines that is almost about to win and lines where the enemy is about to win but is instead blocked by the AI's pieces. However, there are two checks that override these point values: if the board state is such that the AI wins, then we immediately return 1000. If the enemy is about to win, then we immediately return -1000. That way, any board state that blocks the enemy from almost winning is immediately favored.

</p>

<p>
Briefly outline the functions you created in your code to carry out the
algorithmic steps you described earlier.
<ul>
  <li>ultimateheuristic(board,depth,player,alpha,beta);</li> 
  <li> new_minimax(): This function takes 4 inputs: board,depth, player,alpha and beta. Board and player are used to calculate the heuristic value at the leaf node. Depth is for look ahead. alpha and beta are for alpha-beta purning. The function will generate all the possible moves by the player, evaluate all the possible boards and return the best score of the board.</li>
  <li>possibleWinLines(board,player): This function take two inputs: board and player. It will return all the possible winning combinations based on the current board for a certain player.</li>
  <li>almostWinInLine(board, position_list, player): This is a helper function which takes 3 inputs. This function will return whether a player has 3 pieces placed on a winning row already, and there is no enemy's move on that row.</li>
  <li>hasWon(board,player): This function will return whether a player has already won.</li>
</ul>>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>
Describe your experiments, including the number of tests that you
performed, and the relevant parameter values.  
We tested our AI algorithm with random player. We won 100% of the time.
Then we tested our AI algorithm with human player, the AI won most of time.
</p>
<p>
Define your evaluation
metrics, e.g., detection rates, accuracy, running time. </p>


<hr>
<h2> Results</h2>
<p>
List your experimental results.  Provide examples of input images and output
images. If relevant, you may provide images showing any intermediate steps.  If
your work involves videos, do not submit the videos but only links to them.
Our heuristic function correctly evalute the current board, and our minimax algorithm correctly give us the best move. Our AI beats the random player everytime and it also beats the human player.

<h2> Discussion </h2>

<p> 
Discuss your method and results:
<ul>
<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method? </li>
<li>Do your results show that your method is generally successful or
     are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your
     experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your
     results. </li>
<li>Potential future work. How could your method be improved?   What
would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the
failures/limitations of your work?</li> 
</ul>
